## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Learned some new things about drag and drop API.
I completed that challenge without any JS frameworks, with Vanilla JS. It was hard, expecially managing the task data. At the beggining my files were a complete mess, but later I somehow divided it into separate files. I still think it could look better, and will work on improving it.

### What next in this project

I am planning to adding some things and improvements to this project:

- Adding buttons to task to allow to reorder with keyboard navigation, as alternative to drag and drop
- Some animations
- Refactoring JavaScript files
- ...
